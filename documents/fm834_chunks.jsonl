Do not interpolate or adjust the protection values obtained from these tables. 2.1.4.5.2 Minimum Ceiling Design Area 2.1.4.5.2.1 Unobstructed Ceiling Construction The minimum design area (i.e., the number of sprinklers in the design multiplied by the spacing of the sprinklers) is as follows: 1. 576 ft2 (53.5 m2) when the number of sprinklers in the indicated design is 9 2. 640 ft2 (59.5 m2) when the number of sprinklers in the indicated design is 10 3. 768 ft2 (71.3 m2) when the number of sprinklers in the indicated design is 12 or more Increase the number of sprinklers in the ceiling design, when applicable, to meet or exceed the required minimum design area. 2.1.4.5.2.2 Obstructed Ceiling Construction When ceiling sprinklers can be installed under the ceiling structural members in the presence of obstructed ceiling construction, follow the guidelines for minimum ceiling design area indicated in Section 2.1.4.5.2.1. When ceiling sprinklers are required in every channel created by obstructed ceiling construction, and the linear and area sprinkler spacing is in accordance with Data Sheet 2-0, a minimum ceiling design area is not applicable. 2.1.4.5.3 Non-ASRS Areas Adjacent to an ASRS Storage Area 2.1.4.5.3.1 Provide separation between the ASRS storage area and any adjacent non-ASRS areas by either full-height walls or minimum 2 ft (0.6 m) deep draft curtains. 2.1.4.5.3.2 Separation between the ASRS storage area and any adjacent non-ASRS areas, as recommended in Section 2.1.4.5.3.1, is not needed when: 1. Both the ASRS storage area and the adjacent non-ASRS area require the same ceiling-level sprinkler design and use the same RTI rated sprinklers, or 8-34 Protection for Automatic Storage Page 10 FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheets ©2017-2024 Factory Mutual Insurance Company. All rights reserved. 2. The ceiling-level sprinkler system designs are different, but the ceiling-level sprinkler system with the higher demand has been extended one sprinkler or one branch line, depending on how the sprinkler piping is arranged, into the area requiring the lower ceiling-level sprinkler demand. Note that if the ceiling-level sprinklers protecting the two adjacent areas have different RTI ratings (i.e., quick-response and standard-response), then a minimum 2 ft (0.6 m) deep draft curtain is needed as separation between these two sprinkler types. 2.1.4.5.4 Number of Sprinklers per Branch Line for Ceiling-Level Sprinkler System Calculations Instead of using the calculation methods in Data Sheet 3-0, use Table 1 to determine the number of ceiling-level sprinklers needed per branch line for hydraulic calculation purposes. Use Data Sheet 3-0 for all other means of determining the flow and pressure required for a sprinkler system. When using Equation 1 or Equation 2, if the result is not a whole number, round to the nearest whole number using normal rounding methods (i.e., round down for 0.49 or less; round up for 0.50 and greater). Equation 1: Number of Sprinklers per Branch Line in Design Area, Ceiling Slope ≤1 in 12 = (1.2 / SAVG) x SQRT ([Number of Sprinklers in Ceiling Design x SAVG x LAVG]) Where: SAVG = Average on-line spacing used within the calculated sprinkler system. LAVG = Average between line spacing used within the calculated sprinkler system. Equation 2: Number of Sprinklers per Branch Line in Demand Area, 1 in 12 < Ceiling Slope ≤2 in 12 = (1.4 / SAVG) x SQRT ([Number of Sprinklers in Ceiling Design x SAVG x LAVG]) Where: SAVG = Average on-line spacing used within the calculated sprinkler system. LAVG = Average between line spacing used within the calculated sprinkler system. Note that the average distance is indicated for Equations 1 and 2 to account for fluctuations in spacing due to the presence of ceiling structural members or similar potential obstructions. The most common sprinkler spacing can be used when sprinkler spacing values are generally consistent.

Review the battery replacement program regularly and include, at a minimum, the following components: 1. Regular monitoring of the state of health of batteries which is generally available through the BMS, particularly for li-ion batteries. 2. The OEM design life expectancy of the batteries. This will be based on the number of years and the number of cycles that the battery is expected to perform adequately. After this point, the batteries will have performance deterioration (i.e., capacity decrease) due to aging condition, the likelihood of thermal runaway will also increase, and the batteries should be replaced. 3. When replacing a Li-ion battery with a different chemistry, consult with the battery and equipment OEM to ensure matching of performance such as voltage between the charger and the level required by the Li-ion battery packs and their battery management systems. Do not replace lead-acid batteries with Li-ion batteries. Prevention Data Sheet 7-43, Process Safety, for any major changes planned for the ASRS electrical system. To minimize potential property damage and business interruption due to loss of the control systems responsible for the operation of the ASRS storage system, review and implement the recommendations outlined in FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheet 7-110, Industrial Control Systems, that are applicable to the facility’s ASRS.

Small Trays 2.2.1.1.1 Section 2.2 provides protection guidelines for horizontal-loading automatic storage and retrieval systems (ASRS). This type of storage arrangement is further subdivided into two specific types of ASRS storage: (1) a shuttle ASRS, and (2) a mini-load type ASRS. A shuttle ASRS has horizontal supports that do not interfere with the flow of sprinkler discharge into the transverse flue space. See Figure 2 for an example of this storage arrangement. The shuttle system shown in Figure 2 uses metal slats for the support of the trays or containers; other shuttle systems use mesh type or similar shelving to support the trays or containers. A mini-load type ASRS uses angle irons, or similar guides, for the support of trays or containers within the rack structure. See Figure 3 for an example of this storage arrangement. Fig. 2.

All rights reserved. 2.2.1.1.2 What differentiates horizontal-loading ASRS storage arrangements from traditional pallet load storage rack arrangements include: 1. Rack uprights in a mini-load type ASRS that are typically only about 2 ft (0.6 m) apart horizontally as opposed to about 8 ft (2.4 m), 2. Tiers that are only about 12 to 18 in. (300 to 450 mm) high as opposed to about 5 ft (1.5 m), 3. Product handling that consists of 18 in. x 24 in. (450 mm x 600 mm) trays or open-top containers as opposed to 4 ft x 4 ft (1.2 m x 1.2 m) pallets, 4. Material handling support in mini-load type ASRS storage arrangements which is accomplished by angle irons as opposed to horizontal supports. While bullet points 1 through 4 create a unique storage arrangement for horizontal-loading ASRS, it is the presence of the angle irons within the mini-load ASRS rack structure that has a major impact on the protection requirements for them. This is because the angle irons divert most of the sprinkler discharge out to the face of the rack, thus limiting the amount of sprinkler discharge that can be distributed into the transverse flue spaces of the storage rack. 2.2.1.1.3 To determine recommendations for the protection of products stored within a horizontal-loading ASRS storage array, use the following generic procedure: 1. See Section 2.1 for general recommendations that apply to all ASRS storage arrangements, including construction, occupancy, protection and final extinguishment. 2. See Section 2.2.1 for additional general recommendations that apply specifically to horizontal-loading ASRS storage arrangements. 3. Obtain the specific protection guidelines from the applicable section for the type of storage being maintained within the horizontal-loading ASRS. The applicable sections are as follows: A. Section 2.2.2 for shuttle ASRS arrangements that use closed-top, noncombustible, solid-walled containers or FM Approved, non-propagating, open-top containers. Fig. 3.

Section 2.2.4 for shuttle ASRS arrangements that use either (1) open-top cardboard or unexpanded plastic containers, or (2) products or containers that collect water and are stored on trays. D. Section 2.2.5 for mini-load ASRS arrangements that use closed-top, noncombustible, solid-walled containers or FM Approved, non-propagating, open-top containers E. Section 2.2.6 for mini-load ASRS arrangements that use either (1) products that do not collect water that are stored on trays, or (2) closed-top combustible containers. F. Section 2.2.7 for mini-load ASRS arrangements that use either (1) open-top cardboard or unexpanded plastic containers, or (2) products or containers that collect water and are stored on trays. 2.2.1.1.4 The protection of expanded plastic trays or expanded plastic containers in a mini-load type of horizontal-loading ASRS storage array is outside the scope of this data sheet. To determine the protection options available within Section 2.2, the following information is needed: 1. Maximum commodity hazard to be protected (see Data Sheet 8-1, Commodity Classification) 2. Depth of the ASRS unit (rack row depth; see Appendix A for a definition of this term) 3. Material composition (i.e., chemical construction) of the trays and/or containers used for material handling 4. Type of containers (closed-top, solid-walled open-top, and non-solid walled open-top) 5. Transverse flue space width 6. Horizontal distance between transverse flue spaces 7. Longitudinal flue space width (if provided) 8. Tier height 9. Maximum storage height 10. Maximum ceiling height over the storage area 2.2.1.3.1 Properly anchor all horizontal-loading ASRS rack structures to prevent them from falling over and causing nearby racks to fall over (i.e., a “domino” effect). Take into consideration the effects of rack loads, the additional load created by the collection of fire protection water by the stored commodity and its container (see Section 2.1.2.5), the weight of water-filled, in-rack sprinkler piping (if provided), any seismic conditions (see FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheet [i.e., Data Sheet] 1-2, Earthquakes) and the type of flooring to which the rack structure will be anchored to. Retain a qualified structural engineer to perform the analysis and design of any anchoring of the storage racks. 2.2.1.3.2 Design horizontal-loading ASRS rack-supported structures taking into consideration the effects of weather (wind, snow, rain, hail, etc.), rack loads, seismic conditions (see Data Sheet 1-2), and the additional load created by the stored commodity and/or its container collecting or absorbing fire protection water (see Section 2.1.2.5), the weight of water-filled sprinkler piping (from ceiling or in-rack sprinklers), and any other loads to which the rack or structure may be exposed. Transverse Flue Spaces 2.2.1.4.1 When measuring for the net width of a transverse flue space, account for the width of any angle irons or alignment guides, located between containers or trays, that are pitched at an angle less than 30º. 2.2.1.4.2 Transverse Flue Spaces a Nominal 2 ft (0.6 m) Apart: Where the horizontal distance between transverse flue spaces is a nominal 2 ft (0.6 m) or less, transverse flue spaces are considered adequate when: 1. Minimum 2 in. (50 mm) gross wide transverse flue spaces are provided between containers or trays for transverse flue spaces at rack uprights, and 2. Minimum 2 in. (50 mm) net wide vertically aligned transverse flue spaces are provided between containers or trays for transverse flue spaces that are not at rack uprights. 8-34 Protection for Automatic Storage Page 16 FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheets ©2017-2024 Factory Mutual Insurance Company.

However, vertical barriers can be avoided when: 1. The transverse flue spaces are not vertically aligned, but the width of the transverse flue spaces is in accordance with Section 2.2.1.4.2, 2.2.1.4.3, and 2.2.1.4.4, or 2. The width of the transverse flue spaces is not in accordance with Sections 2.2.1.4.2, 2.2.1.4.3, and 2.2.1.4.4, but the net width of the transverse flue spaces is at least 2 in. (50 mm). 2.2.1.4.6 When Section 2.2.1.4.5 indicates that vertical barriers are needed, install the vertical barriers at rack uprights on maximum 10 ft (3.0 m) horizontal spacing. Arrange the vertical barriers to cover the entire depth of the rack row as well as the entire storage height located between each vertical level of in-rack sprinklers. Note that the vertical barriers do not need to extend into the roughly 1 ft (0.3 m) high horizontal space where in-rack sprinklers are being installed. 2.2.1.5.1 Sprinkler System Types 2.2.1.5.1.1 Ceiling-Level Sprinkler System Types 1. Depending on the ambient temperature of the ASRS area being protected, ceiling-level sprinkler systems can be: a. Wet-pipe sprinkler systems b.

Noncombustible, Solid-Walled Containers, or FM Approved, Non-Propagating, Open-Top Containers are Being Used Noncombustible, Solid-Walled Containers are Being Used 2.2.2.1.1 Automatic sprinkler protection can be designed for the surrounding occupancy hazard when Closed-Top, Noncombustible, Solid-Walled Containers are used throughout the entire horizontal-loading ASRS storage array. 2.2.2.1.2 Where closed-top, noncombustible, solid-walled containers are being used, but not throughout the entire storage array, provide protection in accordance with the worst-case container or tray being used. Non-Propagating Open-Top Containers are Being Used (Reserved) Protection guidelines for FM Approved, non-propagating, open-top containers will be provided upon the release of a FM Approval Standard specific to these types of containers. Combustible Containers, or (2) Products that Do Not Collect Water that are Stored on Trays The protection guidelines in Section 2.2.3 apply only to storage that is not considered open-top, whether stored directly on the support rails of the ASRS or on trays. Such products will be subsequently referred to in Section 2.2.3 as “storage on trays”. If the product or containers allow for water collection, use the protection guidelines provided in Section 2.2.4. Section 2.2.3 is organized as follows: • Section 2.2.3.1 determines if a ceiling-only protection option is available and, if it is, the recommended ceiling-only protection designs. • Section 2.2.3.2 determines the recommended designs when both ceiling and in-rack sprinklers are installed. This section is further broken down into the following subsections: - Section 2.2.3.2.1 provides acceptable horizontal in-rack sprinkler arrangements. - Section 2.2.3.2.2 provides both the acceptable vertical in-rack sprinkler arrangements as well as the corresponding in-rack sprinkler system design. - Section 2.2.3.2.3 provides the acceptable ceiling sprinkler system design with the chosen in-rack sprinkler system arrangement. Storage on Trays 2.2.3.1.1 A ceiling-only sprinkler system protection scheme is possible when: 1. Adequately aligned transverse flue spaces as outlined in Section 2.2.1.4 are provided, and 2. For Class 1 through 4, cartoned plastics, and uncartoned unexpanded plastics, minimum 3-1/2 ft (1.1 m) wide aisles are provided for ceiling heights not exceeding 30 ft (9.1 m), and 3. Minimum 4 ft (1.2 m) wide aisles are provided when: a. Uncartoned, expanded plastics are stored in the racks, or b. The ceiling height exceeds 30 ft (9.1 m) (unless indicated otherwise by a footnote at the bottom of the applicable protection table), and 4. For the given material handling scenario outlined in this section, ceiling-only protection is provided per the applicable protection table (Tables 4 through 13) for the specific sprinkler being installed at ceiling level, and 5. The water supply can provide the flow and pressure requirements for the protection option chosen from the applicable protection table. 8-34 Protection for Automatic Storage Page 20 FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheets ©2017-2024 Factory Mutual Insurance Company. All rights reserved. If the conditions outlined in (1) through (5) cannot be met, see Section 2.2.3.2 regarding the guidelines for installing in-rack sprinklers in combination with ceiling-level sprinklers. 2.2.3.1.2 When a ceiling-only protection scheme is acceptable per items (1) through (5) in Section 2.2.3.1.1, use Table 3 to determine which protection table provides the recommended ceiling sprinkler design, depending on the commodity hazard, the type of material handling being used (i.e., directly on the rack’s horizontal supporting rails or on trays) and the type of ceiling sprinkler system (i.e., wet or dry) being installed. 2.2.3.1.3 See Section 2.2.1.6 to determine the ceiling sprinkler’s hose demand design and water supply duration. 2.2.3.1.4 See Section 2.1.4.5.4 to determine the number of sprinklers per branch line for ceiling-level sprinkler calculations.

All rights reserved. 2.2.3.2.2 Vertical Location of In-Rack Sprinklers and In-Rack Sprinkler System Designs for the Protection of Closed-Top Combustible Containers, or Storage on Trays 2.2.3.2.2.1 Storage Racks Not Requiring Vertical Barriers 1. When Section 2.2.1.4 indicates that vertical barriers are not required due to transverse flue spaces being provided, use the following tables to determine the allowable in-rack sprinkler vertical locations, as well as the corresponding recommended in-rack sprinkler design: A. Table 15: Wet, In-Rack sprinkler system protecting a shuttle ASRS, or B. Table 16: Dry, In-Rack sprinkler system protecting a shuttle ASRS 2. Any green highlighted protection cell within Table 15 represents (1) an arrangement where the in-rack sprinkler system and the ceiling sprinkler system do not need to be hydraulically balanced at their point of connection, and (2) a potential design where the top in-rack sprinkler tier level can represent a virtual floor. The ceiling sprinkler system can be designed using the applicable protection table (i.e., Tables taking the vertical distance between the top level of in-rack sprinklers and the actual ceiling above. However, for this option to be applicable, the aisle width must be acceptable for a ceiling-only protection option as indicated in Section 2.2.3.1.1. 3. While the in-rack sprinkler designs given in Tables 15 and 16 are based on flow, the corresponding design pressure for the chosen in-rack sprinkler cannot be less than 7 psi (0.5 bar). When the design pressure will be less than 7 psi (0.5 bar), use a minimum pressure of 7 psi (0.5 bar) for design purposes, regardless of the in-rack sprinkler’s K-factor value. 2.2.3.2.2.2 Storage Racks Requiring Vertical Barriers When Section 2.2.1.4 indicates that vertical barriers are required due to the lack of acceptable transverse flue spaces, install the in-rack sprinklers vertically using the design guidelines indicated in Section 2.2.3.2.2.1. However, include all the in-rack sprinklers installed between the vertical barriers in the in-rack sprinkler design. For example, if a wet, in-rack sprinkler system is being used to protect Class 3 commodity being stored within a shuttle ASRS protected with in-rack sprinklers per Figure 6, and the number of in-rack sprinklers between the vertical barriers is 9; the design for the in-rack sprinkler system would be per Table 15 and could use either (1) 9 IRAS @ 30 gpm (115 L/min), which would require the ceiling and in-rack system to be hydraulically balanced, or (2) 9 IRAS @ 65 gpm (250 L/min), which would avoid the need for the ceiling and in-rack sprinkler system to be hydraulically balanced. 8-34 Protection for Automatic Storage Page 36 FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheets ©2017-2024 Factory Mutual Insurance Company.

All rights reserved. 2.2.3.2.3 Ceiling Sprinkler System Designs in Combination with In-Rack Sprinklers for the Protection of Closed-Top Combustible Containers, or Storage on Trays 2.2.3.2.3.1 For wet ceiling sprinkler systems, when Table 15 or Section 2.2.3.2.2.2 indicates the storage height above the top in-rack sprinkler level be limited to 10 ft (3.0 m), use Table 17 to determine how to obtain the ceiling sprinkler system design. If a protection option is not available from the applicable protection table, either: 1. Install a flat, continuous, noncombustible false ceiling capable of withstanding an uplift pressure of 3 lb./ft² (14.4 kg/m²) over, and for a minimum of 15 ft (4.6 m) beyond, the ASRS storage area in all directions, with sprinklers installed underneath the false ceiling in accordance with Table 17, or 2. Install in-rack sprinklers over the top of storage and design the ceiling sprinkler system per Table 17. 2.2.3.2.3.2 For wet ceiling sprinkler systems, when Section 2.2.3.2.2.2 is not applicable and Table 15 does not limit the storage height above the top in-rack sprinkler level, the ceiling sprinkler system can be designed using the applicable protection table (i.e., Tables 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, depending on the commodity hazard being protected). The ceiling height to be used in the protection table is obtained by taking the vertical distance between the top in-rack sprinkler level and the ceiling. Note that if no storage is to be maintained above the top in-rack sprinkler level, the ceiling design can be determined using the lowest ceiling height given in the protection table. 2.2.3.2.3.3 For dry ceiling sprinkler systems, use Table 18 to determine how to obtain the ceiling sprinkler system design. If a protection option is not available from the applicable protection table, either: 1. Install a flat, continuous, noncombustible false ceiling, capable of withstanding an uplift pressure of 3 lb/ft² (14.4 kg/m²), over the ASRS storage area and for a minimum of 15 ft (4.6 m) beyond the ASRS area in all directions with sprinklers installed underneath the false ceiling in accordance with Table 18, or 2. Install in-rack sprinklers over the top of storage and design the ceiling sprinkler system per Table 18. 2.2.3.2.3.4 See Section 2.2.1.6 to determine the ceiling sprinkler’s hose demand design and water supply duration. 2.2.3.2.3.5 See Section 2.1.4.5.4 to determine the number of sprinklers per branch line for ceiling-level sprinkler calculations. 8-34 Protection for Automatic Storage Page 44 FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheets ©2017-2024 Factory Mutual Insurance Company.

All rights reserved. Combustible Containers are Being Used Note that the protection of expanded plastic containers is outside the scope of this data sheet. Section 2.2.4 is organized as follows: • Section 2.2.4.1 determines if a ceiling-only protection option is available and, if it is, the recommended ceiling-only protection designs. • Section 2.2.4.2 determines the recommended designs when both ceiling and in-rack sprinklers are installed. This section is further broken down into the following subsections: - Section 2.2.4.2.1 provides acceptable horizontal in-rack sprinkler arrangements. - Section 2.2.4.2.2 provides both the acceptable vertical in-rack sprinkler arrangements as well as the corresponding in-rack sprinkler system design. - Section 2.2.4.2.3 provides the acceptable ceiling sprinkler system design with the chosen in-rack sprinkler system arrangement. Arrangements Using Open-Top, Combustible Containers 2.2.4.1.1 A ceiling-only sprinkler system protection scheme is possible when: 1. Adequate vertically aligned transverse flue spaces are provided as outlined in Section 2.2.1.4, and 2. The storage height does not exceed 10 ft (3.0 m), and 3. A ceiling-only protection is provided in the applicable protection table (Tables 20 and 21) for the specific sprinkler being installed at ceiling level, and 4. The water supply can provide the flow and pressure requirements for the protection option chosen from the applicable protection table. If the conditions outlined in (1) through (4) cannot be met, see Section 2.2.4.2 regarding the guidelines for installing in-rack sprinklers in combination with ceiling-level sprinklers. 2.2.4.1.2 When a ceiling-only protection scheme is acceptable per items (1) through (4) in Section 2.2.4.1.1, use Table 19 to determine which protection table to use for obtaining the recommended ceiling sprinkler design depending on the commodity hazard and the type of ceiling sprinkler system (i.e., wet or dry) being installed.

When Section 2.2.1.4 indicates that vertical barriers are not required due to transverse flue spaces being provided, use the following tables to determine the allowable in-rack sprinkler vertical locations as well as the corresponding recommended in-rack sprinkler design: A. Table 32: Wet, In-Rack sprinkler system protecting a mini-load type ASRS, or B. Table 33: Dry, In-Rack sprinkler system protecting a mini-load type ASRS 2. The maximum storage height above the top in-rack sprinkler level is 10 ft (3.0 m). 3. While the in-rack sprinkler designs given in Tables 32 and 33 are based on flow, the corresponding design pressure for the chosen in-rack sprinkler cannot be less than 7 psi (0.5 bar). When the design pressure will be less than 7 psi (0.5 bar), use a minimum pressure of 7 psi (0.5 bar) for design purposes, regardless of the in-rack sprinkler’s K-factor value. 2.2.6.2.2.2 Storage Racks Requiring Vertical Barriers When Section 2.2.1.4 indicates that vertical barriers are required due to the lack of acceptable transverse flue spaces, install the in-rack sprinklers vertically using the design guidelines indicated in Section 2.2.6.2.2.1. However, include all of the in-rack sprinklers installed between the vertical barriers in the in-rack sprinkler design. For example, if a wet, in-rack sprinkler system is being used to protect cartoned unexpanded plastic commodity being stored within a mini-load ASRS which is to be protected with in-rack sprinklers per Figure 28, and the number of in-rack sprinklers between the vertical barriers is 9, then the design for the in-rack sprinkler system would be per Table 32 and would be designed for (1) 9 IRAS @ 60 gpm (230 L/min) as opposed to 6 IRAS @ 60 gpm (230 L/min).

All rights reserved. 2.3.5.3.2 Hose Demand Design Guidelines Include a minimum flow of 250 gpm (950 L/min) for the hose demand design. 2.3.5.3.3 Water Supply Duration Size the water supply feeding the ceiling sprinkler system and the hose stream demand, when taken from the same water supply, for a minimum of 60 minutes. 2.3.6.1.1 General 2.3.6.1.1.1 Due to the lack of direct access by the local fire service to the fire area, review the recommendations in this section that are intended to establish a means by which final extinguishment can be achieved. 2.3.6.1.1.2 At a minimum, implement the recommendations in Sections 2.3.6.1.2, 2.3.6.1.3, and 2.3.6.1.4, unless indicated otherwise in Section 2.3.6.1.5. 2.3.6.1.1.3 See Section 2.3.6.1.5 for ceiling-level protection options that will allow for the elimination of some recommendations offered for final extinguishment. 2.3.6.1.1.4 When the guidelines of Section 2.3.6.1.5 are not met, see Sections 2.3.6.1.6 through 2.3.6.1.9 for recommendations to review and discuss with the local fire service to potentially assist with achieving final extinguishment. Implement those recommendations deemed necessary by either the authority having jurisdiction or the appropriate representatives from the local fire service. 2.3.6.1.2 Pre-Incident Plan 2.3.6.1.2.1 For TL-ASRS storage arrangements that use solid-walled containers, establish a pre-incident plan with the local fire service that takes into consideration how the local fire service will gain access to any point of the ASRS storage grid for final extinguishment purposes. Items to consider, at a minimum, are: A. Access to the storage grid itself (i.e., removal of any separating walls or fences), B. A plan to remove storage containers along with a place to put them, and C. A means of preventing robots from falling from the grid into the storage area. 2.3.6.1.2.2 See Section 2.1.5 for additional guidance on pre-incident planning. 2.3.6.1.3 Storage Arrangement To allow local fire service access to the fire area, arrange the TL-ASRS storage arrangement as follows: 1. Establish readily accessible, clearly marked designated locations along the side walls of the ASRS unit that can be used as access points to the storage area. Provide as many access points as possible to limit the horizontal distance between the access point and the potential fire area within the storage area. 2. Consider limiting the horizontal distance between one end of the storage array and the opposite end to a maximum of 100 ft (30 m). 2.3.6.1.4 Mezzanines and/or Platforms 2.3.6.1.4.1 To allow local fire service access adjacent to the top of the storage grid where strategic planning can occur and hose streams can potentially be applied, install mezzanines and/or platforms at a minimum, along the longer walls of the ASRS unit at a height equal to or above the storage grid. See Figure 47 for examples of mezzanines and/or platforms. Note that if the maximum width of the storage array is 50 ft (15 m), then only a single mezzanine and/or platform would be needed. Determine from the local authority having jurisdiction the minimum width of the mezzanine and/or platform they would require and the minimum number of access points for each mezzanine and/or platform area. 2.3.6.1.4.2 If the horizontal distances between the ends of the storage array will exceed 100 ft (30 m) in both directions, in addition to mezzanines and/or platforms install solid-floored elevated mezzanine levels 8-34 Protection for Automatic Storage Page 92 FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheets ©2017-2024 Factory Mutual Insurance Company.

All rights reserved. 2.3.6.1.6 Small Hose Connection Stations 2.3.6.1.6.1 To aid in manual fire-fighting efforts and after-extinguishment mop-up operations, consider the installation of small hose connection stations near the floor-level access points established for the local fire service and on the mezzanine levels (perimeter and elevated), if provided. Consult with the local fire service or authority having jurisdiction to determine their recommendations regarding: A. The use of wet- or dry-barrel stations, and B. The size of the hose connections, and C. The horizontal distance between stations 2.3.6.1.6.2 Design the small hose connection station system to provide a minimum flow of 50 gpm (190 L/min) from each of the two most hydraulically remote stations (100 gpm [380 L/min] total). 2.3.6.1.6.3 Arrange the water supplies feeding these stations in one of the following ways: A. A piping system dedicated solely for the small hose connection stations, or B. Piping that connects the stations to a sprinkler system that is different than the one protecting the ASRS storage area 2.3.6.1.6.4 The installation of small hose connection stations can be avoided (if so chosen by the end user) by obtaining written confirmation from the local authority having jurisdiction and/or local fire service that they would not plan to use the small hose connection stations during a fire event. 2.3.6.1.7 Vertical Barriers 2.3.6.1.7.1 To assist with firefighting efforts, consider the installation of vertical barriers throughout the ASRS storage area. When vertical barriers are to be provided throughout the storage area, install them as follows: A. Use minimum 20-gauge (0.9 mm) sheet metal for the vertical barriers B. Install the barriers from floor level to the top of the storage array C. Attach the vertical barriers to each of the storage columns with a minimum of 3 tech screws per column (near the top, middle, and bottom) D. Provide a minimum 3 in. (75 mm) overlap, sealed with fire-rated silicone, of the barriers with the floor and all sheet metal joints E. Where the vertical barriers are required at corners, bend the sheet metal around the corner to avoid any seams at these locations 2.3.6.1.7.2 Arrange the vertical barriers to limit the subdivided storage area to a maximum size of 1,000 ft2 (93 m2). 2.3.6.1.7.3 Maintain one row of storage on one side and adjacent to each of the vertical barriers free of combustibles as shown in Figure 49. 2.3.6.1.7.4 To aid with access to the fire area, limit the number of vertical barriers for each subdivided area to 3 or less as demonstrated in Figure 49. 2.3.6.1.7.5 Vertical barriers would be considered redundant with protection installed in accordance with Section 2.3.6.1.5, Sections 2.3.6.1.8 and 2.3.6.1.9. As a result, if the protection outlined in Section 2.3.6.1.5 regarding ceiling sprinkler protection, or Sections 2.3.6.1.8 and 2.3.6.1.9 regarding fixed-in-place monitor nozzles, are implemented, the installation of vertical barriers would not be needed.

Due to the lack of direct access by the local fire services to the fire area, recommendations in this section are intended to establish a means by which final extinguishment can be achieved. 2.3.7.7.1 Storage Arrangement and Mezzanines A. To allow the fire service to access the top of the storage grid where hose streams can be applied, arrange the TL-ASRS storage as follows: 1. Limit the horizontal distance between one end of the storage array and the opposite end to a maximum of 100 ft (30 m) as shown in Figure 54. 2. Install perimeter mezzanines, at a minimum, along the longer walls of the ASRS unit at a height equal to or above the storage grid as shown in Figure 54. Determine from the local authority having jurisdiction the minimum width of the mezzanine they would require and the minimum number of access points for each perimeter mezzanine area.

Establish readily accessible, clearly marked designated locations along the side walls of the ASRS unit that can be used as access points to the storage area. Provide as many access points as possible to limit the horizontal distance between the access point and the potential fire area within the storage area. See Figure 54 for an example of this arrangement. B. If the horizontal distances between the ends of the storage array will exceed 100 ft (30 m) in both directions, install solid-floored elevated mezzanine levels that will limit the horizontal distances between mezzanines to 100 ft (30 m) and the maximum horizontal distances for hose stream application to 50 ft (15 m). Arrange the elevated mezzanines to allow robots the ability to pass underneath them. See Figure 55 for an example of this arrangement. C. The installation of elevated mezzanines, as outlined in Section 2.3.7.7.1(B), can be avoided at the written discretion of the local authority having jurisdiction. 2.3.7.7.2 Small Hose Connection Stations A. To aid in manual fire fighting efforts and after-extinguishment mop-up operations, install small hose connection stations near the floor-level access points established for the local fire service and on the mezzanine levels (perimeter and elevated). Consult with the local fire service or authority having jurisdiction to determine their recommendations regarding the following: 1. The use of wet- or dry-barrel stations, and 2. The size of the hose connections, and 3. The horizontal distance between stations. B. Design the small hose connection station system to provide a minimum flow of 50 gpm (190 L/min) from each of the two most hydraulically remote stations (100 gpm [380 L/min] total). C.

Piping that connects the stations to a sprinkler system that is different than the one protecting the vertically enclosed ASRS storage unit the local authority having jurisdiction. Mini-load ASRS typically consist of multiple levels of trays or containers that slide into a rack structure that use angle irons for material handling support (see Figure 57). The rack structure generally consists of rack uprights that are somewhat smaller, such as 2 in. (50 mm) wide by 3 in. (75 mm) deep (see Figure 58), compared to traditional pallet-load type rack uprights. The rack uprights tend to be on the order of 18 in. (450 mm) to 24 in. (600 mm) horizontally apart parallel to the loading aisle. Tier heights will vary but are usually from 9 in. (225 mm) to 16 in. (400 mm) in height. While some systems can be small, others are used as rack-supported structures where they act as the structural support for the building they are in (see Figure 59) and thus can be very tall. Trays or containers used for product handling are removed from the rack by a motorized automated picking robot (see Figure 60). Trays and containers are typically constructed of unexpanded plastic; however, some containers are constructed of noncombustible, cellulosic, or expanded plastic materials. Containers are usually open-top. The picking robot, located in the aisle on a set of rails, is typically operated via a computer terminal. The robot can move in three directions: back and forth in the aisle, up and down the height of the rack, and in and out of the rack when removing or returning a container to its location. Depending on the size of the system, more than one robot may be used. Aisles are usually a minimum of about 3 ft (0.9 m) wide. There are various types of containers in which parts may be stored within the retrieval system. For purposes of providing protection guidelines they have been divided into the following three groups: noncombustible containers, cellulosic containers, and plastic containers. 8-34 Protection for Automatic Storage Page 110 FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheets ©2017-2024 Factory Mutual Insurance Company. All rights reserved. These containers are typically painted or galvanized sheet metal. When product is maintained in closed-top, solid-walled containers, the fire hazard is greatly reduced due to the shielding of the product from direct flame impingement and therefore in-rack sprinkler protection is not typically required. When the containers are open-top and have solid walls, the fire growth is typically very slow, and the solid walls help reduce the likelihood of horizontal fire spread. However, if the container walls or bottoms are non-solid, then heat transfer is more readily achieved and the protection needed is driven by the product inside the container. These containers are typically single-walled or double-walled thick cardboard. They can be closed-top or open-top. While the heat release rate of cellulosic containers is less than those made of plastic, they tend to ignite easier and burn faster than containers constructed from unexpanded plastics. As a result, care is needed to make sure the horizontal in-rack sprinkler arrangement recommended for them is appropriate to avoid the fire from growing vertically past the in-rack sprinklers when installed on a wet sprinkler system. While some cellulosic containers may have venting along the bottom sides of the container perpendicular to the loading aisle, most containers either have no vents or vents in the bottom of the container, which would reduce the amount of sprinkler discharge realized in the transverse flue spaces. These containers are typically constructed using injection molded plastic; however, containers are sometimes made of expanded or corrugated plastic. Expanded plastic containers are currently outside the scope of the data sheet. They are very often open-top but can be closed-top. Care must be taken in classifying closed-top containers because most of these containers use folding tops that do not seal completely, which allows water that collects on top of them to drain into the container, thus creating an open-top container hazard. Unexpanded plastic containers are typically either solid throughout or collapsible where the hinge is located near the bottom of container. This hinge does allow for water to vent from the container in a timely fashion provided that the hinge is located close enough to the bottom of the container and the product inside the container will not block the water from escaping.

Under each grid opening is a solid-piled column of storage containers that are vertically aligned due to the angle irons provided on the metal support columns. The containers used in TL-ASRS storage arrangements are almost always open-top and made from various plastics, such as polyethylene (HDPE) or polypropylene. The top of the grid acts as a track across which remotely operated robots transverse; the robots are used to either remove containers from the storage grid for picking operations, or are used to return containers to their designated storage location. The track that the robots operate on is about the same width as the flue spaces surrounding each container.", "provenance": {"page": 110}}

The track that the robots operate on is about the same width as the flue spaces surrounding each container. Robot chargers are connected to AC or DC supply networks. Multiple chargers exist at various locations around the grid, requiring extensive runs of cables around the grid. The chargers condition the power (rectification/step down) to a level that is acceptable for the robot. The robots’ batteries may be fixed to chassis or removable for charging. In designs with fixed batteries, the robot is stationary at the charging station while the batteries are being charged. In the case of removable batteries, robots deposit the batteries at the charging station for charging and acquire a fully charged battery at another station to continue operation. The robot may be powered by an ultra-capacitor during this transition. This leads to a system with higher uptimes and overall productivity per robot. In general, the batteries in use are one of two types: lead-acid or lithium-ion with the latter gaining more popularity in recent times. For designs with Li-ion batteries, charging rates could be substantially higher than for the lead acid counterparts. This can put additional stress on the current carrying parts of the battery pack and charger in addition to the batteries themselves, which tend to heat at higher current levels. A Battery Management System (BMS) is provided for the safe operation of the Li-ion battery pack. Batteries use different chemistries. As indicated above, the chemistries typically observed in top-loading ASRS robots are lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries. Lead-acid batteries are typically of the sealed type. Li-ion batteries consist of several Li-ion cells (cylindrical or prismatic) connected in series/parallel combination to meet the voltage, power, and capacity requirements of the application. The battery pack also consist of the BMS and instrumentation to continuously monitor the battery state of charge, state of health. The BMS also provides safety operation limits on charge/discharge voltage and currents. The chargers for these Li-ion batteries follow specific charging profiles depending on the Li-ion chemistry used in the cells. Vertically enclosed systems can vary in size but are usually of the “lift” or the “carousel” type. The lift type uses a robotic picker to store and remove trays that rest on fixed storage supports within the unit and deliver it to the user, whereas the conveyor type uses a rotating storage arrangement that brings the storage tray to the user. Typical systems are package units in which metal trays supported on a rack structure are contained within a metal enclosure. Systems are often used for storage of parts that are high in value and very prone to heat, smoke, or water damage, or parts that are low in value but critical for production. Such situations warrant the installation of supplemental protection to help further reduce loss potentials. Loss experience shows that when there are no major automatic sprinkler system deficiencies, fires in storage occupancies are controlled by the existing sprinkler system protection arrangement. Major protection deficiencies include inadequate water supplies, closed or partially closed valves, obstructed sprinkler piping, missing sprinklers, and ignitable liquid or aerosol protection deficiencies. Protection deficiencies were identified in all storage losses in which the fire was uncontrolled. As of 2017, FM Global clients have experienced very few losses involving automatic storage and retrieval systems (ASRS), but a significant loss involving a rack-supported ASRS took place at a non-client location 8-34 Protection for Automatic Storage Page 114 FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheets ©2017-2024 Factory Mutual Insurance Company.

Reportedly due to deficient welding and design aspects of the rack framing, a portion of a rack-structure ASRS storage unit collapsed starting a domino effect with the remaining rack framing in the warehouse area. Storage in the racking consisted of paper goods, which were then ignited by the building’s lighting system. The building, which was reportedly 10 stories high and 115,000 ft2 (10,685 m2) in size, was completely lost.

ASRS rack row depth: The horizontal length of storage within a mini-load ASRS storage arrangement, measured perpendicular to the loading aisle, between (1) the face of the rack, and (2) either the longitudinal flue space or the back face of the rack when a longitudinal flue space is not provided. See Figure A-1 for a visual representation of this term.

Carousel Storage and Retrieval System: A rotating storage system that uses vertically or horizontally rotating carriers on tracks or chains to move the entire array of stored items, where a summoned shelf or container stops at a designated access point for the storage or retrieval of goods. See Data Sheet 8-33, Carousel Storage and Retrieval Systems, for protection guidelines involving these types of storage arrangements. Closed-top container: A container equipped with a solid cover that will prevent water from entering the top. The cover can be an integral part of container, such as a corrugated cardboard box with folding flaps that are then sealed closed (typically with glue or packing tape). It can also be a fixed-in-place lid. If a fixed-in-place lid is used, it needs to be expected to stay in place during a fire event and not allow water to enter the top of the container. Fixed-in-place monitor nozzle: A non-portable monitor nozzle that is attached directly to either a floor or a ceiling structure. The nozzle itself, however, can be moved as needed to direct water discharge to the fire area. Horizontal-loading ASRS storage arrangement: An automatic storage and retrieval system where material handling is conducted in a horizontal plane, similar to standard storage racks, but with robots that load and unload small containers or trays. There are two types of horizontal-loading ASRS storage arrangements currently addressed in this standard, which are mini-load and shuttle type ASRS arrangements. K-factor: Also known as the discharge coefficient, it is a numerical value representing the orifice size of the sprinkler in combination with the expected flow through the sprinkler orifice at a given pressure value. It is used to calculate the flow from a sprinkler by taking the square root of the pressure available at the sprinkler multiplied by the sprinkler’s K-factor. The units for the K-factor are gpm/psi0.5 (Lpm/bar0.5). Local fire service: The responding personnel, paid or volunteer, whose assigned task would be to provide final extinguishment of a fire that originates within an ASRS storage array. Longitudinal flue space: A flue space that is parallel to the loading aisle having a minimum width of 3 in. (75 mm) and a maximum width of 24 in. (600 mm). Note that any flue space that is parallel to the loading aisle having a minimum width over 24 in. (600 mm) as an aisle for in-rack sprinkler location purposes. Mini-load ASRS storage arrangement: An automatic storage and retrieval system that uses trays or small totes/containers for material handling as opposed to traditional pallet loads. They are differentiated from other storage racks due to the presence of angle irons, which result in the diversion of sprinkler discharge toward the face of the rack and away from both the longitudinal and transverse flue spaces. Mini-load ASRS rack structures typically use rack uprights that are about 18 to 24 in. (450 to 600 mm) horizontally apart and are about 2 to 3 in. (50 to 75 mm) in size (both width and depth). Tier heights are roughly 1 ft (0.3 m) and product handling is typically supported on angle irons (see Figure 3). Modular in-rack sprinkler protection arrangement: An in-rack sprinkler protection arrangement that is designed to prevent the vertical spread of fire beyond the first level of in-rack sprinklers that the fire encounters. This in-rack sprinkler arrangement therefore allows the in-rack design to be based on the operation of a given number of sprinklers at only one level and does not need to account for ceiling sprinkler operation as part of its design. Monitor nozzle: A nozzle used for water discharge to a fire area that can turn 360º in a horizontal plane while also having a limited play in a vertical plane. Non-solid-walled container (top-loading ASRS): A container that has openings on any of its side walls. The protection requirements for these types of containers differ from those for solid-walled containers when maintained in a TL-ASRS storage arrangement. Open-top container: A container with walls higher than 1 in. (25 mm) that either does not have a top cover or is not equipped with a cover capable of preventing water from entering the container. Note that this includes open-top containers filled with product to any height within the container. Rack structure ASRS storage arrangement: An automatic storage and retrieval system that is similar to traditional open-frame storage racks except that (1) the horizontal distance between rack uprights is sized for only one pallet load, and (2) the support within the rack for the pallet loads tends to be either roller-type conveyors or horizontal supports that are oriented perpendicular to the loading aisle as opposed to parallel to it. Protection guidelines for these storage arrangements are provided in Data Sheet 8-9, Storage of Class 1, 2, 3, 4 and Plastic Commodities. 8-34 Protection for Automatic Storage Page 116 FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheets ©2017-2024 Factory Mutual Insurance Company. All rights reserved. Shuttle-type ASRS storage arrangement: An automatic storage and retrieval system that uses trays or small totes/containers (as opposed to traditional pallet loads) for material handling. What differentiates these ASRS storage arrangements from mini-load ASRS storage arrangements is the storage racks typically use slatted shelving (that are void of vertical alignment guides) on which the materials, trays, or containers rest. As a result, the rack structure does not inherently divert water away from the flue spaces that surround the stored product, provided the slats do not result in a blocked transverse flue space. Shuttle-type ASRS rack structures typically use rack uprights that are about 8 to 10 ft (2.4 to 3.0 m) horizontally apart and are about", "provenance": {"page": 116}}

(32 mm) in height, that is typically either roughly (1) 16 x 24 x 15 in. tall (400 x 600 x 375 mm tall) in size, or (2) slightly wider in footprint but does not exceed 18 in. (450 mm) in height. Small tray (i.e., tray): A flat product material handling platform typically about 16 x 24 in. (400 x 600 mm) in size, that has a vertical lip around its perimeter that does not exceed more than 1.25 in. (32 mm) in height. Solid-walled open-top container (top-loading ASRS): A container that has no openings on any of its side walls. The protection requirements for these types of containers differ from those for non-solid-walled containers when maintained in a TL-ASRS storage arrangement. Top-loading ASRS (TL-ASRS): An automatic storage and retrieval system that consists of a metal grid structure under which containers, usually open-top and made of unexpanded plastic, are stacked one on top of another in vertically aligned columns. They are accessed from the top of the grid by service robots that have been programmed to either retrieve a specific container for commodity picking purposes, or for replenishing the amount of commodity maintained within the storage container. Vertical barrier: A barrier that is typically installed within the transverse flue space of a storage rack for the purpose of preventing fire from spreading beyond it. It spans the entire height of the rack as well as its depth, including across any longitudinal flue spaces, from one face of the rack to the other. It is not intended to span across a material-handling aisle located between storage racks. When used in a mini-load ASRS storage arrangement, the vertical barrier can consist of either minimum 22-gauge (0.7 mm) sheet metal or minimum 3/8 in. (10 mm) plywood. For vertical barriers installed in a top-loading ASRS storage arrangement, see the guidelines specified for the barrier in Section 2.3.6.1.7. Vertically enclosed ASRS: An ASRS unit that typically works with a vertical lift system or a vertical carousel. The lift system uses a robotic picker that will store and remove trays that rest on fixed storage supports within the unit and deliver it to the user. The carousel conveyor system uses a rotating storage arrangement that brings the storage tray to the user. Typical systems are package units where metal trays supported on a rack.

The following major changes were made: A. This data sheet now addresses protection options for ASRS vertically enclosed, rack-structure, mini-load, and other storage arrangements in which the horizontal support for product material handling uses rails, angle irons, or other similar supporting structures. When in-rack automatic sprinkler (IRAS) protection is needed, the protection now offered in this data sheet is designed to prevent the fire from growing vertically past the in-rack sprinkler protection that has been installed. With this arrangement, the ceiling and in-rack sprinkler systems operate independent of each other and thus do not need to be hydraulically balanced nor designed with both systems operating concurrently. B. The term “storage sprinkler” has been incorporated into this data sheet to replace “Control Mode Density Area (CMDA) sprinkler.” C. Ceiling-level sprinkler designs now use the “number of sprinklers @ minimum pressure” design format in place of the previously used “density/demand area” design format. D. Added terms to Appendix A, Glossary of Terms. January 2003. Clarification regarding the storage clearance was added. September 2000.
